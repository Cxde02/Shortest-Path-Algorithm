# Shortest-Path-Algorithm

This Java application generates a random graph with specified nodes, assigns each node random x and y coordinates, and calculates the shortest path between two nodes using a graph algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm). The application visualizes the graph and the shortest path, providing the path's length as output.

## Key Features:

<ol>
  <li>Node Generation: Creates nodes with random coordinates.</li>
<li>Graph Construction: Connects nodes based on specified criteria (e.g., distance, probability).</li>
<li>Shortest Path Algorithm: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.</li>
<li>Visualization: Displays the calculated shortest path.</li>
<li>Output: Provides the length of the shortest path.</li>
</ol>
