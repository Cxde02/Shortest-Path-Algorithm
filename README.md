# Shortest-Path-Algorithm

This Java application generates a random graph with specified nodes, assigns each node random x and y coordinates, and calculates the shortest path between two nodes using a graph algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm). The application visualizes the graph and the shortest path, providing the path's length as output.

## Key Features:

Node Generation: Creates nodes with random coordinates.
Graph Construction: Connects nodes based on specified criteria (e.g., distance, probability).
Shortest Path Algorithm: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path.
Visualization: Displays the calculated shortest path.
Output: Provides the length of the shortest path.
